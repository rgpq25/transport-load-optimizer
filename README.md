# Transport Load Optimizer

**Transport Load Optimizer** is a research-oriented project focused on solving the delivery loading problem for a ceramic products company. It implements and compares two optimization approaches: a hybrid **Genetic Algorithm with Simulated Annealing (GA-SA)** and the **Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP)**.

Both algorithms aim to assign pre-stacked product blocks (pallets) into transport units along predefined delivery routes, optimizing vehicle utilization while satisfying delivery constraints such as weight, volume, stacking rules, time windows, and priority levels.
